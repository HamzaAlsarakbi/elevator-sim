### Milestone 1:
- Create three separate threads for the identified subsystems: Floor, Elevators, and Scheduler.
- Ensure proper synchronization and communication between threads to facilitate the flow of information.
- Design a data structure that efficiently represents hardware device information (e.g., floor button, elevator button).
- Use this data structure for passing necessary information between the Floor subsystem, Scheduler, and Elevators.
- Enable the Floor subsystem to read events from the input file, parse the information, and send it to the Scheduler using the designed data structure.
- Implement communication channels that allow the Scheduler to reply when there is work to be done, and the Elevator to send relevant data back to the Scheduler.
